## Setup required to run locally

### Create environment variables

Two files: `.env.test` and `.env.development` must be created at the top level of the file structure. These should define the environment variable `PGDATABASE` for the test and development database respectively. Set `PGDATABASE` to equal the name used for the relevant database in your local setup. The two files should be git ignored.
